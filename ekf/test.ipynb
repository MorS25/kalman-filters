    "There are `N` players on the field passing the ball to each other. Initially, the ball can be dropped to any player on the field. The player possessing the ball can throw it to another one _if and only if_ they see one another. The group of players which can pass the ball between themselfs form a team. There is a chance that the player, which got the ball in the beginning, doesn't see anybody and thereafter he makes its own 'lordly' team. The task is to find the team with largest number of members.\n",

In latest example we have seen that _find set_ operation costs `O(V)`, here we will optimize it up to `O(a(V))`, where **`a(V)` is about 1**.
